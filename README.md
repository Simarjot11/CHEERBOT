# CHEERBOT
SCOPE OF OUR CHATBOT:  we designed a chatbot to know almost all the problems faced by each age group of people of our society and to overcome that in this pandemic.
Here, we will discuss the problems which everyone is facing in this pandemic, so for our convenience, we divided the age-group in the following manner:

1) TEENAGER AND STUDENTS
2) PROFESSIONALS/ MID AGE GROUP 
3) OLD AGE GROUP PEOPLE

PROBLEMS FACING BY TEENAGERS AND STUDENTS:

a) EFFECT ON STUDIES: from the past six months, the field which is
    being affected by the pandemic most is the educational field. All the
    schools/colleges are closed and students have to suffer their studies
    for that.

b) BORED AND LONELINESS: in this age, when every student has a
    gesture to live his/her own kind of life, this pandemic shut all the doors
    for them to expose themselves, students are away from their friends
    and their studies which results in them to feel bored and lonely.

c) OVERTHINKING AND ANXIETY: this age group of people have a
    rapid mind-set and if they use it in a wrong way, then a big problem
    related to their career may occur.

d) HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE: yes, health and physique are equally
    important as studies for teenagers. But in this pandemic, gyms as well
    as the parks are closed , so the people are unable to control their diet
    and are unable to do exercises.



PROBLEMS FACING BY MID AGE GROUP PEOPLE:

a)	JOB LOST/ JOB SECURITY/ BUSINESS LOSS: suddenly, this pandemic came and affected the mid age group very much because many people had to lose their jobs because everything was shut, business leaders also suffered a big loss during the pandemic.

 b)  HOUSEHOLD FINANCES: those who lost their jobs in the
     pandemic are the ones who earn from the daily basis work and
     fulfill their livelihood. But they had to leave their houses in this   
     Pandemic.

c) LOAD OF WORK DUE TO WORK FROM HOME: someone lost 
   their job, so someone has to fill his place by doing extra work in the
   same income for their job security, they didn't get a single leave 
    (even on weekends ) throughout the pandemic.

d) HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE: to maintain their body and to prepare
   themselves for the work, physical as well as the mental preparation
   are important, that was nor possible in the pandemic due to extra
   load of work , so it results in causing laziness in people. 



PROBLEMS FACED BY OLD AGE GROUP PEOPLE:

a) BORED AND LONELINESS: it is impossible for any age group of
        people to stay in his bed throughout a day and due to this  
        pandemic , old age people also got stuck in their houses.

b) LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES: normal hospitals turned into covid
       hospitals, so the old age people who suffer from regular diseases
       like diabetes, blood pressure had to suffer for their treatment.


c) HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE: it is seen that this age group people love
    to go out in natural air to feel fresh and do yoga and different activities
    with their mates in parks but in this pandemic, it couldn't be possible.

d) CORONA PHOBIA: for those, who’ve never seen this kind of 
    pandemic throughout his life watch the news……during the pandemic,
    this amount of people get corona positive on this day and this amount
    of people have lost their life…….suffers with a phobia which affects
    their mental strength.

FUTURE SCOPE:  

This bot has a great future scope ,because in the field of psychology , till now AI and Machine learning trained bots are not present at a large scale but this field requires these bots to make people more aware about their mental health and these bot also suppresses the privacy issue of someone's  personal life  . This also helps introverts to share their thoughts without actually conversing with a person . 
Moreover in next updates of Cheerbot we are planning to make it on a larger scale with more problems and solutions adding to  it and providing more data set to the Bot for every situation so that it can also deal with people the same way like a living psychologist would do. And moreover the bot would become capable of making your online appointment with a real psychologist in very serious situations.
